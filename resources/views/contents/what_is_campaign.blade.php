Good day Nairalanders!!

I just created a Telegram group for mini Importers & those who are interested in Importing items from China at cheaper rates but can't meet the Minimum order quantity(MOQ) of an item to connect and Import together.

Do you want to start a business but you can't meet the MOQ? This group is for you.

Do you want to Import items for personal use
and can't meet the MOQ? This group is also for you.

Check my signature to join!


Are you a spammer that likes spamming people's group? I'm sorry but this group isn't for you.

Do you like Robbing people of their hard earned money? I'm so sorry, this group is not for you too.

Please, check the next group.



A group buy is a process through which we, as a community, can use our collective buying power to purchase goods at a reduced price or at all.  Some Group Buys take advantage of price breaks to offer products to the community at a more desirable price, often at the cost of the GB organizer's time/efforts.  Others simply give us the ability to make something happen that otherwise would have too much cost/risk associated with it for a vendor to buy into it and bring it to market themselves.
